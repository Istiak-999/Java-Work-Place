Consider that you have been hired to design and develop a 
university management system. Write Java Code for the problem.
For the first version of the system, you are required to 
1. store the information of all the Teachers, Students and Courses. 
2. For Teachers and Students you must  store first name, last name, department, and age. 
3. Teachers also have Employee Id and monthly salary. 
4. The student has Student Id and Course information that he has enrolled in. 
5. A course has a course title, course code, total enrolled student, and total credit hours.

A course has assigned to course teachers and when a student
is enrolled in a course then the number of enrolled 
students increased. Need to calculate Teachers and Staff 
yearly salary and Teachers have 10% bonus and staff have
 a 5% bonus. We also need to know that how many students 
are enrolled in a specific subject and Total credit hours
 are taken by Specific teaches.
